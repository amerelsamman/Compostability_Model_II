SIMULATION PARAMETERS (CORRECTED):
==================================
- Blending Rule: Inverse Rule of Mixtures for all blends
- Temperature Range: 23-50°C (logarithmic scaling, max 5x)
- Humidity Range: 50-95% (logarithmic scaling, max 3x)
- Thickness Range: 10-600μm (dynamic reference, power law 0.5)
- Noise: 10% Gaussian noise
- Polymer Selection: 40% 2-polymer, 30% 3-polymer, 20% 1-polymer, 5% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer
- Additional Columns: property_unnnormal (OTR without thickness normalization), unit (cc*um/m2/day)

COMPARISON WITH ORIGINAL:
=========================
The corrected OTR simulation now EXACTLY matches the original simulation_otr_data.py:
✅ Same temperature ranges (23-50°C)
✅ Same humidity ranges (50-95%)
✅ Same thickness ranges (10-600μm)
✅ Same noise levels (10%)
✅ Same polymer selection weights (40/30/20/5/5 including 1-polymer option)
✅ Same scaling functions and parameters
✅ Same environmental scaling bounds
✅ Same additional columns (property_unnnormal, unit)

MODEL CHARACTERISTICS:
======================
- Algorithm: XGBoost Regressor
- Features: 98 total (93 numerical + 5 categorical)
- Categorical Encoding: One-hot encoding
- Regularization: Gentle regularization applied
- Target: Log-transformed OTR values
- Validation: 80/20 split with last 21 blends in training and last 2 in testing

NOTES:
======
This corrected version should now produce results identical to the original OTR simulation.
The model shows good performance on training and test sets, with some degradation on the last 2 blends
which is expected for a memorization model approach.

CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:
==========================================
1. **MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS**: Previous version had NO temperature or humidity!
2. **WRONG THICKNESS RANGE**: 10-300μm vs 10-600μm
3. **WRONG SCALING**: Fixed reference vs dynamic reference
4. **MISSING COLUMNS**: No property_unnnormal, no unit, no Temperature, no RH
5. **WRONG WEIGHTS**: Default weights vs OTR-specific weights including 1-polymer option
6. **WRONG NOISE**: 20% vs 10%

These fixes ensure the OTR simulation is now functionally identical to the original system.
