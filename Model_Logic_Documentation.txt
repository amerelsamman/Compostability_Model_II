• Estimate mechanical properties (Tensile Strength, Elongation at Break) as function of thickness
• Calculate Cobb Value (water absorption capacity) as intrinsic material property
• Model home compostability kinetics with thickness-dependent degradation

🔧 Technical Approach:
• Molecular descriptors extracted from SMILES representations using RDKit
• Volume fraction-weighted combination of individual polymer features
• Gradient boosting and Random Forest models for each property
