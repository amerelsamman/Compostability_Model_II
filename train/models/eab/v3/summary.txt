RECENT CHANGES FROM v4:
- Changed oversampling rate from 10x to 2x for last 4 blends
- Removed "hard and soft flex" material rule from augmentation
- Now uses only "brittle and soft flex" coincidence rule
- Material types read from data 'type' column (not hardcoded)
- Dual property handling (EAB1 and EAB2) like TS models
- Rule-based augmentation with inverse/regular rule of mixtures
- Miscibility rule: ≥30% immiscible components → EAB = random(5-7%)
- Thickness scaling: EAB * (thickness^0.4 / 25^0.4)
- Random thickness generation: 10-300μm
- 25% Gaussian noise added for realism
- **NEW: Replaced Random Forest with XGBoost model**
- **XGBoost parameters: n_estimators=80, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1**
- **REVERTED: Removed brittle+hard material rule (back to original brittle+soft flex only)**

AUGMENTATION RULES:
- Rule Selection Based on Material Types:
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'brittle' and 'soft flex' materials → Inverse Rule of Mixtures
  * Otherwise → Regular Rule of Mixtures
- Miscibility rule: If ≥30% immiscible components, EAB = random(5-7%) due to phase separation
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
- Completely random polymer selection (all grades included)
- Random compositions using Dirichlet distribution
- Weighted randomness: 50% 2-polymer, 30% 3-polymer, 15% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer
