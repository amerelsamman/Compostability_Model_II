RECENT CHANGES FROM V2:
- Implemented crystallinity logic for EAB (same as TS)
- Non-rigid polymers (EAB >= 150%): PBAT (all), PCL (all), PHB (Green Planet™ PHBH only), PHA (PHACT A1000P only)
- Crystallinity effect applied when: non-rigid polymers > 40% volume AND crystallinity difference exists
- Crystallinity difference checked across ALL polymers in blend (not just non-rigid ones)
- Crystallinity factor = sum of vol_fractions for non-rigid polymers with high/low crystallinity
- Crystallinity exception formula: EAB_reduced = EAB / (8 * crystallinity_factor)
- Added ZeroDivisionError prevention with crystallinity_factor > 0 check
- Maintained composition-dependent rule selection (inverse vs plain rule of mixtures)

DATA AUGMENTATION METHOD:
- Composition-Dependent Rule of Mixtures:
  * Inverse Rule of Mixtures when lower EAB polymer dominates (dominant_position < 0.5)
  * Plain Rule of Mixtures when higher EAB polymer dominates (dominant_position >= 0.5)
- Crystallinity exception: Applied if non-rigid polymers > 40% volume AND crystallinity difference exists
- Thickness scaling: EAB * (thickness^0.4 / 25^0.4)
- 25% Gaussian noise added for realism
- Random thickness generation: 10-300μm
- Weighted randomness: 50% 2-polymer, 30% 3-polymer, 15% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer

MODEL FILES:
- Baseline: models/eab/v4/last4_training/
- Testing: models/eab/v4/last4_testing/
- Both include: comprehensive_polymer_model.pkl, performance plots, training explanation

ERROR ANALYSIS:
- Model error (126.5-148.5%) is LESS than data variability (153.8-241.6%)
- Model performing well relative to inherent data noise
- Relative MAE/CV ratios: 0.52-0.97 (good performance)
