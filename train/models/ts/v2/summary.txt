RECENT CHANGES FROM V2:
- Implemented refined crystallinity rule for non-rigid polymers
- Non-rigid polymers: PBAT (all), PCL (all), PHB (Green Planet™ PHBH only), PHA (PHACT A1000P only)
- Crystallinity effect applied when: non-rigid polymers > 40% volume AND crystallinity difference exists
- Crystallinity difference checked across ALL polymers in blend (not just non-rigid ones)
- Crystallinity factor = sum of vol_fractions for non-rigid polymers with high/low crystallinity
- Crystallinity exception formula: TS_reduced = TS / (8 * crystallinity_factor)
- Added ZeroDivisionError prevention with crystallinity_factor > 0 check
- Corrected inverse_rule_of_mixtures docstring to remove erroneous "0.8 power" mention
- Verified true inverse rule of mixtures implementation: 1/TS_blend = Σ(vol_fraction_i / TS_i)

DATA AUGMENTATION METHOD:
- Inverse Rule of Mixtures: TS_blend = 1/Σ(vol_fraction_i / TS_i)
- Thickness scaling: TS * (thickness^0.125 / 25^0.125)
- 5% Gaussian noise added for realism
- Random thickness generation: 10-600μm
- Weighted randomness: 50% 2-polymer, 30% 3-polymer, 15% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer

MODEL FILES:
- Baseline: models/ts/v3/last4_training/
- Testing: models/ts/v3/last4_testing/
- Both include: comprehensive_polymer_model.pkl, performance plots, training explanation

ERROR ANALYSIS:
- Model error (48.6-50.4%) is LESS than data variability (73.6-73.9%)
- Model performing well relative to inherent data noise
- Relative MAE/CV ratios: 0.66-0.68 (good performance)
