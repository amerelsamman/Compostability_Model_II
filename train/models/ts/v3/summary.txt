TS V5 MODEL SUMMARY
===================

MODEL TYPE: XGBoost Regressor (Dual Property: MD/TD)
TRAINING DATE: Latest run
AUGMENTATION: 5000 blends using rule-based approach

AUGMENTATION RULES:
- Rule Selection Based on Material Types:
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'brittle' and 'soft flex' materials → Inverse Rule of Mixtures
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'hard' and 'soft flex' materials → Inverse Rule of Mixtures  
  * Otherwise → Regular Rule of Mixtures
- Miscibility rule: If ≥30% immiscible components, both MD and TD = random(5-7 MPa)
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
- Thickness scaling: TS * (thickness^0.125 / 25^0.125) for both MD and TD
- Random thickness generation: 10-600μm
- Added 5% Gaussian noise to both MD and TD predictions

FEATURIZATION:
- Input: data/ts/polymerblends_for_ml.csv (5031 samples)
- Output: data/ts/polymerblends_for_ml_featurized.csv (5031 samples, 104 features)
- Features: Molecular descriptors, functional groups, carbon types, etc.

TRAINING MODELS:

1. MODEL.PY (Last 4 in Training):
   - Target: MD (TS1) and TD (TS2) properties
   - Log transformation applied to both targets
   - Last 4 blends always in training set
   - Oversampling: Last 4 blends repeated 2x
   - XGBoost parameters:
     * n_estimators=80, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1
     * subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8
     * reg_alpha=0.2, reg_lambda=2.0
     * min_child_weight=1, gamma=0.0
   - Output: models/ts/v5/last4_train/

2. MODEL_LAST4TEST.PY (Last 4 in Testing):
   - Target: MD (TS1) and TD (TS2) properties  
   - Log transformation applied to both targets
   - Last 4 blends always in testing set
   - Oversampling: Last 12 blends (16-4) repeated 20x in training
   - XGBoost parameters:
     * n_estimators=120, max_depth=7, learning_rate=0.1
     * subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8
     * reg_alpha=0.2, reg_lambda=2.0
     * min_child_weight=1, gamma=0.0
   - Output: models/ts/v5/last4_test/

RECENT CHANGES:
- Changed from Random Forest to XGBoost models
- Applied specific XGBoost hyperparameters for better performance
- Maintained dual property prediction (MD/TD)
- Kept existing data splitting logic and oversampling strategies
