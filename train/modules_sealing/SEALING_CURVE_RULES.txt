                    SEALING PROFILE GENERATION RULES & CONSTRAINTS
                    ===============================================

This document summarizes the mathematical rules, physical constraints, and 
implementation details for generating sealing strength vs temperature curves 
in the Polymer Blends Training system.

================================================================================

1. CUBIC POLYNOMIAL SEALING CURVES
==================================

1.1 MATHEMATICAL FORMULA
------------------------
y = ax³ + bx² + cx + d

Where:
- y = sealing strength (N/15mm) at temperature x
- a, b, c, d = polynomial coefficients
- x = temperature in Celsius

1.2 BOUNDARY POINTS (4 CONSTRAINTS)
------------------------------------
The cubic polynomial must pass through these 4 points:

Point 1: (T1 - 20°C, 1.0 N/15mm)
- T1 = lowest melting temperature in the blend
- Represents initial sealing strength of 1 N/15mm at low temperature
- Physical meaning: Basic sealing capability at room temperature

Point 2: (T1, property1_weighted)
- T1 = lowest melting temperature in the blend  
- property1_weighted = adhesion strength of first polymer × its volume fraction
- Represents reaching the weighted sealing strength of the first polymer
- Physical meaning: First polymer reaches its composition-weighted sealing capability

Point 3: (T_optimal, optimal_strength)
- For NEAT POLYMERS: (T_midpoint, plateau_strength)
  * T_midpoint = midpoint between melt temperature and degradation temperature
  * plateau_strength = base_property × 1.2 (20% increase for optimal processing)
  * Physical meaning: Neat polymer reaches optimal sealing at midpoint temperature
- For BLENDS: (T_blend_ROM, ml_predicted_strength)
  * T_blend_ROM = rule of mixtures temperature of the blend
  * ml_predicted_strength = ML model prediction for adhesion strength
  * Physical meaning: Blend reaches its ML-predicted maximum sealing capability
  * Fallback: Uses rule of mixtures if ML prediction gives invalid results

Point 4: (T_degradation, 0.0 N/15mm)
- T_degradation = min(degradation_temperature_i) for all polymers in blend
- Represents complete loss of sealing strength due to degradation
- Physical meaning: Material degrades and loses all sealing capability

1.3 COEFFICIENT SOLVING
-----------------------
The system has 4 equations and 4 unknowns, so we can solve exactly:

a) 4 point constraints:
   - Point 1: a*(T1-20)³ + b*(T1-20)² + c*(T1-20) + d = 1.0
   - Point 2: a*T1³ + b*T1² + c*T1 + d = property1_weighted
   - Point 3: a*T_blend_ROM³ + b*T_blend_ROM² + c*T_blend_ROM + d = ml_predicted_strength
   - Point 4: a*T_degradation³ + b*T_degradation² + c*T_degradation + d = 0.0

b) Solution method:
   - Use numpy.linalg.solve for exact solution
   - Fallback to linear interpolation if matrix is singular

1.4 PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
------------------------
After generating the polynomial curve:

a) Strength bounds: 0 ≤ y ≤ 100 N/15mm
   - Minimum: 0 (no sealing capability)
   - Maximum: 100 (reasonable upper bound for polymer sealing)

b) Temperature bounds: 0 ≤ x ≤ 300°C
   - Minimum: 0°C (room temperature)
   - Maximum: 300°C (reasonable upper bound for polymer processing)

c) Realistic sealing behavior: Strength increases then decreases with temperature
   - Initial increase: From low temperature to optimal sealing temperature
   - Peak strength: At rule of mixtures temperature (optimal processing)
   - Decrease: From peak to degradation temperature
   - Physical meaning: Optimal sealing occurs at blend's processing temperature

d) No NaN or infinite values
   - Ensure all generated values are finite
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

2. BOUNDARY POINT CALCULATIONS
==============================

2.1 TEMPERATURE CALCULATIONS
-----------------------------
a) T1 (Lowest melting temperature):
   - T1 = min(polymer['melt temperature'] for polymer in polymers)
   - Represents the first polymer to melt in the blend

b) T_blend_ROM (Rule of mixtures temperature):
   - T_blend_ROM = Σ(composition_i × melt_temperature_i)
   - Represents the weighted average melting temperature of the blend

c) T_degradation (Degradation temperature):
   - T_degradation = min(polymer['degradation temperature'] for polymer in polymers)
   - Uses actual degradation temperatures from masterdata.csv
   - Represents temperature where sealing strength drops to zero

2.2 STRENGTH CALCULATIONS
-------------------------
a) Initial sealing strength: 1.0 N/15mm
   - Conservative starting value
   - Represents basic sealing capability

b) First polymer strength: polymer1['property'] × composition1
   - Uses actual adhesion strength of first polymer weighted by its composition
   - Represents composition-weighted capability of first polymer

c) Optimal strength: System-specific calculation
   - For NEAT POLYMERS: base_property × 1.2 (20% plateau increase)
   - For BLENDS: ML model prediction for adhesion strength
   - Fallback: Σ(composition_i × property_i) if ML prediction gives invalid results
   - Represents optimal sealing capability of the system

d) Degradation strength: 0.0 N/15mm
   - Complete loss of sealing capability
   - Represents material failure

3. PHYSICAL RATIONALE
=====================

3.1 SEALING STRENGTH VS TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIP
-------------------------------------------------
- At low temperatures: Polymers are solid, basic sealing strength (1 N/15mm)
- As temperature increases: Polymers soften, sealing strength increases
- At first polymer melting: First polymer reaches its composition-weighted strength
- At blend melting temperature: Maximum sealing strength (rule of mixtures)
- Above blend melting: Sealing strength decreases rapidly
- At degradation temperature: Complete loss of sealing capability

3.2 BLEND BEHAVIOR
------------------
- First polymer (lowest melting temp) determines initial behavior
- Rule of mixtures temperature represents blend average behavior
- Rule of mixtures strength represents expected blend performance
- Degradation represents ultimate failure point
