EOL DATA AUGMENTATION REPORT
============================================================

BASIC STATISTICS:
- Number of original samples: 35
- Number of augmented samples: 5000
- Total dataset size: 5035 rows

RULES APPLIED:
- Complex blending rules for max_L (disintegration) and t0 (time to 50% disintegration):
  * Rule 1: All home-compostable polymers (max_L > 90) → max_L = random(90-95), t0 = weighted average
  * Rule 2: PLA + compostable polymer (≥15%) → max_L excludes PLA, t0 includes PLA
  * Default: Rule of mixtures for both properties
- Noise: ±5% for max_L, ±10% for t0
- Two properties: property1 (max_L), property2 (t0)

GENERAL FEATURES:
- Completely random polymer selection (all grades included)
- Random compositions using Dirichlet distribution
- Weighted randomness: 70% 2-polymer, 20% 3-polymer, 5% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer
- SMILES structures mapped from material-grade dictionary
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
