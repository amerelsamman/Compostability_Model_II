EAB DATA AUGMENTATION REPORT
============================================================

BASIC STATISTICS:
- Number of original samples: 27
- Number of augmented samples: 5000
- Total dataset size: 5027 rows

RULES APPLIED:
- Rule Selection Based on Material Types:
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'brittle' and 'soft flex' materials â†’ Inverse Rule of Mixtures
  * Otherwise â†’ Regular Rule of Mixtures
- Thickness scaling: power law of 0.4 (EAB increases with thickness)
- Random thickness generation: 10-300Î¼m
- Added 5% Gaussian noise

GENERAL FEATURES:
- Completely random polymer selection (all grades included)
- Random compositions using Dirichlet distribution
- Weighted randomness: 70% 2-polymer, 20% 3-polymer, 5% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer
- SMILES structures mapped from material-grade dictionary
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
