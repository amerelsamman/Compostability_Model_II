TS DATA AUGMENTATION REPORT
============================================================

BASIC STATISTICS:
- Number of original samples: 27
- Number of augmented samples: 10
- Total dataset size: 37 rows

RULES APPLIED:
- Rule Selection Based on Material Types:
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'brittle' and 'soft flex' materials → Inverse Rule of Mixtures
  * If blend contains coincidence of 'hard' and 'soft flex' materials → Inverse Rule of Mixtures
  * Otherwise → Regular Rule of Mixtures
- Miscibility rule: If ≥30% immiscible components, both MD and TD = random(5-7 MPa) due to phase separation
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
- Fixed thickness scaling: TS * (thickness^0.125 / 25^0.125) for both MD and TD
- Random thickness generation: 10-600μm
- Added 5% Gaussian noise to both MD and TD predictions

GENERAL FEATURES:
- Completely random polymer selection (all grades included)
- Random compositions using Dirichlet distribution
- Weighted randomness: 70% 2-polymer, 20% 3-polymer, 5% 4-polymer, 5% 5-polymer
- SMILES structures mapped from material-grade dictionary
- Immiscible materials: Bio-PE, PP, PET, PA, EVOH (all grades)
